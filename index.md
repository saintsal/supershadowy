    # SUPER SHADOWY üë•

    Super Shadowy meets are for practitioners and autodidacts to learn from each other. We share **first-hand experience only** to keep things real.

    We're decentralised: 
    * Anyone can schedule a super shadowy meet
    * Nobody is in charge
    * There are no official communication channels

       
    ## MEET FORMAT

    ‚è∞ Each meet is 90 minutes max, and includes several 10- to 25-minute sessions. 

    üë• Each session presenter picks how to share, and how they want feedback:

    ### 1. Pick a sharing format

    <div class="gallery">
        <div>
            <h3>
                Demo
            </h3>
            A screenshare showing what you've worked on.
            <img src="images/demo.png" /><br/>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h3>
                Clinic
            </h3>
            A screenshare with a live diagnosis from someone experienced.

            </h3>
            <img src="images/battle.png" /><br/>
            Pick a few people with cool moves to show you what they'd do.

// - Anyone attending can present, with priority to [those most experienced](#experience)

    ## Rules
    - **First-hand experience only** to keep things real
    - **Everyone is a learner**
        Presentations start with a one-liner on what you're trying to figure out next
    - **No slides**  
        Screenshare your actual work, show it live
    - **No recording**
        This is a safe space to share and talk openly
    - **No blabla** 
        Keep the discussion focused on the presenters demo, challenges and their specific context.  Avoid generalities and pet theories.
    - **Hand raises speak first** ‚úã
        To be inclusive to introverts


    ## FAQ

    [Can I share something I learned from someone?]
        Yes!  Sharing your sources and inspirations is useful for others to learn from.  The first-hand only rule just means that you must share your experience of it.  This avoids people presenting things they haven't verified though their own experience and in their own context.

    -

    [What if someone is disruptive or behaves in a way I don't like?]
        If you feel you should, then speak up.  Ideally, you can call out the behaviour and explain how it affects you without making character judgements -- giving them a chance to adapt. Since noone is in charge, it's up to everyone to share responsibility.
        
        But if the person is persistently distruptive, you can also quietly fork the meet.

        Next time, organise a meet yourself, inviting only the people you think are appropriate.  Smaller meets tend to work better anyway.


    - 
    [How do I get the word out without official communication channels?]
        Feel free to use any platform you feel will attract the right practitioners.  Just don't use only those channels.   
        
        Also, if you'd like to meet regularly, use the same and time and place. That way people can set their own reminders.

        The best super shadowy meets are small ones anyway, they're when people share the best stuff.  If you're goal is getting a lot of people through the door, super shadowy isn't your best bet.

    
    -
    [How do I create a safe space?]
        Safer spaces form more easily when people know each other.  They work when feel comfortable both sharing their best stuff, and feel okay looking dumb.

        - Keeping your meet small
        - Keeping your meet between people who know each other
        - Keeping the meet invite-only or word-of-mouth only
        - Organising targetted meets, where the presenters can choose who they want to share with in advance

         Like a fireside chat, exceptt everyone in the room can act as your interviewer.  A few rules:
         - Everyone keeps their mic off.
         - Raise your hand to join as an interviewer.
         - Only 2 interviewers at a time.  
         - When a third interviewer raises their hand, one of the current interviewers must step down by turning off their mic. Then the person waiting can turn their mic on.

        #### Alternative for large groups for high-profile presenters: Tag Team Interview
        - Select 2 or 3 interviewers in advance, choosing a diverse range of interviewers who:
             - have current challenges
             - those challenges represent the main constituents in the group

[[tips]]
    # At the meet
    - If someone is presenting something sensitive, ask everyone to introduce themselves first.

    - Prioritise the more proficient attendees first.


    # Between meets
    - 
    - When you create the guild, think of two things:
      1. The name: Super Shadowy _______ Guild
     2. Distinction: something someone has acheived that shows they are intermediate-level or experienced.  (One thing, try to make it qualitative and avoid defining it by numbers.)  

    Examples:
    - Super Shadowy Solidity Guild
        Distinction: deployed a smart contract to Ethereum mainnet
    -   Super Shadowy Composability Guild
        Distinction: Currently active defi position with complex composition
    -   Super Shadowy ~~UX (User Experience Design)~~ Guild
        Distinction:   ~~hard to pick one since experienced UXers tend to  focus on either research or interface design~~
    -   Super Shadowy User Resercher Guild
        Distinction: Have run research that led to a launched product
    -   Super Shadowy Interface Design Guild
        Distinction: Have run 





    [[decentralised]]
        Mythical man month, can't create a decentralised web from a centralised org

       *(Any "official" infrastructure is a path to [centralisation](https://www.daoistry.com/mindsets/decentralisation/).  Spread the word.  Share where you'd like, but never hand all the  communicatoin keys to any centralised source.)*

       

    [[practice]]
        - Whoever has the most personal experience get to share first
        - If discussions go off track or get too general, return to the specifics of the prsenters case
        *(to avoid hyped stuff that doesn't actually work.  If you you're excited, try it first.)*
        (No zeitgeist or second-hand info, to keep it real.  If you read about it or heard about it, you can only share it what did yourself.)
