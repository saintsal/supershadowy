    # SUPER SHADOWY MEETS 👥

    Super Shadowy meets are for practitioners and autodidacts to learn from each other. 

    **Practitioners only.**   When it's just us, we can be truly honest about how things are going.  (For example, builders only means nobody hustling to recruit.  Founders-only means no investors, employees or clients to impress.)

    We share **first-hand experience only** to keep things real, avoid hype, and expose all those little tricks you do naturally but never think to explain.

    🫂 You can do a shadow meet just for you to share and get one-off help, or meet regularly as a group where multiple people can demo and get feedback.

    🌌 We're **decentralised**:
    * There are no official communication channels
    * Anyone can schedule a super shadowy meet
    * Nobody is in charge
    * You decide who to invite

       
    ## MEET FORMAT

    ⏰ Each meet is 90 minutes max, and includes several 10- to 25-minute sessions. 

    👥 Each session presenter picks how to share, and how they want feedback:

// - Anyone attending can present, with priority to [those most experienced](#experience)

    ## Rules
    - **Everyone is a learner**
        Presentations start with a one-liner on what you're trying to figure out next
    - **No slides**  
        Screenshare your actual work, show it live
    - **No recording**
        This is a safe space to share and talk openly
    - **No blabla** 
        Keep the discussion focused on the presenter's challenges and their specific context.  Avoid generalities and pet theories.
    - **Hand raises speak first** ✋
        To be inclusive to introverts
    - **Mics on, Cameras off** 
        For a relaxed "living room" feeling, and anon-friendly

    ## FAQ

    [Can I share something I learned from someone else?]
        Yes!  Sharing your sources and inspirations is useful for others to learn from.  The first-hand only rule just means that you must share your experience of it.  This avoids people presenting things they haven't verified though their own experience and in their own context.

    -

    [What if someone is disruptive or behaves in a way I don't like?]
        If you feel you should, then speak up.  Ideally, you can call out the behaviour and explain how it affects you without making character judgements -- giving them a chance to adapt. Since noone is in charge, it's up to everyone to share responsibility.
        
        But if the person is persistently distruptive, you can also quietly fork the meet.

        Next time, organise a meet yourself, inviting only the people you think are appropriate.  Smaller meets tend to work better anyway.


    - 
    [How do I get the word out without official communication channels?]
        Feel free to use any platform you feel will attract the right practitioners.  Just don't use only those channels.   
        
        Also, if you'd like to meet regularly, use the same and time and place. That way people can set their own reminders.

        The best super shadowy meets are small ones anyway, they're when people share the best stuff.  If you're goal is getting a lot of people through the door, super shadowy isn't your best bet.

    
    -
    [How do I create a safe space?]
        Safer spaces form more easily when people know each other.  They work when feel comfortable both sharing their best stuff, and feel okay looking dumb.

        - Keeping your meet small
        - Keeping your meet between people who know each other
        - Keeping the meet invite-only or word-of-mouth only
        - Organising targetted meets, where the presenters can choose who they want to share with in advance

    [[demo]]
        # Demo
        ![](images/demo.png)
        ⏰ 3-10 minutes 

        Think of demos as showing, rather than presenting.  If a few friends popped by for 10 minutes, and you wanted to show them what you've done, what parts would skip to?

        Remember to always start with what you're trying to figure out next.

        The best demos are where you load up a bunch of tabs, or files -- where you normally work.  

        Even when things "go wrong" in live demos, that's a good thing here -- it exposes your setup and how you solve problems. This gets you useful feedback that you might not even think to ask for, and you can always demo again next time.  

        


    [[clinic]]
        ![](images/clinic.png)
        # Clinic
        ⏰ 5-15 minutes total (15 minutes hard max)

        ### Your "symptoms"  ⏰ 1 minute
        Start with a question, or any "symptoms" that are on your mind.

        ### Find your diagnoser ⏰ 1-3 minutes
        Ideally, you have an idea of who you'd like to help you, and may have even asked them beforehand.

        If not, ask people from the audience to share a one-liner of what experience they have (in chat or voice, but keep it short)

        Even someone is only a few steps ahead of you, or have a different approach than you'd like, Clinics work great to open new doors.

        Then pick someone and start.

        (If there's really nobody suitable, then switch to a basic [demo](#demo).)

        ### The Diagnosis ⏰ 10-15 minutes 

        Do a screenshare, and ask your helper to treat you like an apprentice.  

        Let them ask questions, and to coach you.

        You might even get to work together, pairing up to try something or fix something.

        User the time contraint to help focus on something specific.

        Keep in mind, you'll also learn more from the group feedback session afterwards.


       
    [[interview]]
        # Interview 

        ![](images/interview.png)
        ⏰ 10-15 minutes 

         Like a fireside chat, except everyone in the room can act as your interviewer.  

         To allow everyone a chance to ask, but also avoid shallow Q&A, there are a few special rules:

         - Everyone keeps their mic off.
         - Raise your hand to join as an interviewer.
         - Only 2 interviewers at a time.  
         - When a third interviewer raises their hand, one of the current interviewers must step down by turning off their mic. Then the person waiting can turn their mic on.

         (If nobody steps down within 30 seconds, the person with their hand raised turns on their mic, and asks a specific interviewer for "their chair".)

         Even if an interviewer steps down, they can always rejoin later by raising their hand again.

        #### Tag Team Interviews - for large groups (30+) or high-profile presenters

        Sometimes, it doesn't make sense to allow anyone to join the stage.  

        In these cases, select 2 or 3 interviewers in advance, choosing a diverse range of interviewers who have different challenges, and can represent the range of backgrounds in the audience. (ie beginner, advanced, indie, large org)

        If specific topics come up, hey can also appoint specific people from the audience to temporarily join as interviewers.


    [[ideastorm]]
        # Ideastorming
        ![](images/ideastorm.png)
        ⏰ 10-15 minutes 

        A way to quickly get a wide range of possibilities by using the collective knowledge of the room.  

        It works by opening a "sticky note" board like Figma or Miro for everyone, who adds notes on any ideas, links or references you should know.

        There are 2 versions of Ideastorm:

        ### Rapid-fire
        **Use this when you need ideas and inspiration.**

        Ask a question and write it on the board.

        Everyone just starts adding sticky notes in response.  The host watches the board, reading them out load, and asking any clarifying questions as they come up.

        ### Researched

        **Use this when you want more informed options and opinions.**

        Ask a question and write it on the board.

        ⏰ Set a 5-10 minute timer, and ask everyone to research options for you, listing them quiety on their own section of the board.

        ⏰ Then take 5 minutes to ask each person to tell everyone only their favourite one. 


    [[battle]]
        # Battle
        ![](images/battle.png)
        ⏰ 10-15 minutes 

        Battle Decks plays off the friendly rivalries in hip-hop, particularly B-Boy Dance Battles where dancers echo and riff of each other, trying to one-up each other with each response.

        It's a great way to show off, play, get inspired and try new things.

        After the demo, the challenger nominates a few people to battle.  They all turn on their screen shares, and ideally start with a file from the demo.

        Then they work live, in parallel, for 10-15 minutes while everyone else watches and chats.  

        In the end, the person who demoed says what they learned, and gives "crowns" to the battlers who they learned from.


[[tips]]
    # At the meet
    - If someone is presenting something sensitive, ask everyone to introduce themselves first.

    - Prioritise the more proficient attendees first.


    # Between meets
    - 
    - When you create the guild, think of two things:
      1. The name: Super Shadowy _______ Guild
     2. Distinction: something someone has acheived that shows they are intermediate-level or experienced.  (One thing, try to make it qualitative and avoid defining it by numbers.)  

    Examples:
    - Super Shadowy Solidity Guild
        Distinction: deployed a smart contract to Ethereum mainnet
    -   Super Shadowy Composability Guild
        Distinction: Currently active defi position with complex composition
    -   Super Shadowy ~~UX (User Experience Design)~~ Guild
        Distinction:   ~~hard to pick one since experienced UXers tend to  focus on either research or interface design~~
    -   Super Shadowy User Resercher Guild
        Distinction: Have run research that led to a launched product
    -   Super Shadowy Interface Design Guild
        Distinction: Have run 





    [[decentralised]]
        Mythical man month, can't create a decentralised web from a centralised org

       *(Any "official" infrastructure is a path to [centralisation](https://www.daoistry.com/mindsets/decentralisation/).  Spread the word.  Share where you'd like, but never hand all the  communicatoin keys to any centralised source.)*

       

    [[practice]]
        - Whoever has the most personal experience get to share first
        - If discussions go off track or get too general, return to the specifics of the prsenters case
        *(to avoid hyped stuff that doesn't actually work.  If you you're excited, try it first.)*
        (No zeitgeist or second-hand info, to keep it real.  If you read about it or heard about it, you can only share it what did yourself.)
