Sharing your sources and inspirations is useful for others to learn from. The first-hand only rule just means that you must share your experience of it. This avoids people presenting things they haven't verified though their own experience and in their own context.</div><div class=page id="What if someone is disruptive or behaves in a way I dont like?"><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=#>home</a> / <span>What if someone is disruptive or behaves in a way I dont like?</span></div><p>If you feel you should, then speak up. Ideally, you can call out the behaviour and explain how it affects you without making character judgements -- giving them a chance to adapt. Since noone is in charge, it's up to everyone to share responsibility.<p>But if the person is persistently distruptive, you can also quietly fork the meet.<p>Next time, organise a meet yourself, inviting only the people you think are appropriate. Smaller meets tend to work better anyway.</div><div class=page id="How do I get the word out without official communication channels?"><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=#>home</a> / <span>How do I get the word out without official communication channels?</span></div><p>Feel free to use any platform you feel will attract the right practitioners. Just don't use only those channels.<p>Also, if you'd like to meet regularly, use the same and time and place. That way people can set their own reminders.<p>The best super shadowy meets are small ones anyway, they're when people share the best stuff.
